# Tropicalization of centered Gaussian distributions on local fields.

LatticeComputation.jl is a julia script I have implemented an algorithm to compute the tropicalization of Gaussian distributions on local fields ([Local fields, Gaussian measures and Brownian motions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9803046.pdf)). 

The algorithm computes the supermodular coefficient of a tropical polynomial that gives the tail distribution function of the vector of valuations of a Gaussian Vector on $K^d$ where $K$ is a local field.
