# Gaussian entropy map for non-archimedian valued fields.

LatticeComputation.jl provides an implementation of an algorithm that computes the tropicalization of "Gaussian distributions" on non-archimedian valued fields ( See [Local fields, Gaussian measures and Brownian motions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9803046.pdf)).

 
The algorithm computes the supermodular coefficient of a tropical polynomial that gives the tail distribution function of the vector of valuations of a Gaussian Vector on $K^d$ where $K$ is a local field. When $K$ is a general non-archimedean valued field, the "entropy" is still well defined but there is no probabilistic structure on $K$, see ([The Gaussian entropy map in valued fields.] https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00767 ).
