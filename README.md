# Tropicalization of centered non archimedean Gaussian distributions

LatticeComputation.jl is a julia script where the algorithm computing the supermodular polynomial associated to a lattice is implemented. It comes with two examples of diffrerent sizes to test the functions and get some intuituion.

### Warning: This code is just a prototype and far from optimized, computationally and mathematically.
